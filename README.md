# Music Player based on Emotions in C
* For my first semester mini project in C, I created a program that is a music player that selects and plays songs based on the user's input of language and emotion.
* The program consists of a user interface that prompts the user to select their desired language and emotion from a list of options.
* Once the user selects their language and emotion, the program searches a pre-defined database of songs categorized by language and emotion. The program retrieves the corresponding song and plays it using a media player library in C.

## Running the Programs
To run the C programs, you need to have a C compiler installed on your system. The programs have been tested on the Code::Blocks IDE in Windows 11.
***You are free to choose any IDE that suits your needs.***

## Structure of Repository
1. [`SongPlayerCode.c`](https://github.com/fromjyce/SongPlayer-In-C/blob/main/SongPlayerCode.c) - The Code snippet is an excerpt from the project that demonstrates how a song is played within the program.
2. [`SongPlayerMain.c`](https://github.com/fromjyce/SongPlayer-In-C/blob/main/SongPlayerMain.c) - The Code represents the entire music player system project, including all of the code necessary for the program to function.
